[# Changelog: BPM Analysis Script
## Version 0.2
This update transitions the script from a command-line tool to a graphical user interface (GUI) application, improving usability and adding new features for more accurate analysis.
### ‚ú® New Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The script is now a user-friendly desktop application built with `tkinter` and `ttkbootstrap`.
    - **File Browser:** Users can now browse and select audio files directly from the application.
    - **Auto-File Detection:** The application automatically finds and loads the first supported audio file in the current directory on startup.
- **BPM Hint:** A new input field allows users to provide an optional "Starting BPM" hint. This helps the algorithm more accurately identify the initial S1-S2 heart sound interval, improving peak detection for recordings where the heart rate is known.
### üöÄ Improvements
- **Peak Detection Algorithm:**
    - The `find_heartbeat_peaks` function was enhanced to use the new user-provided BPM hint to calculate a more precise S1-S2 interval threshold.
    - In the absence of a hint, the automatic detection logic was made more robust by analyzing beat cycle estimates (systolic + diastolic intervals) rather than just the median of all peak intervals.
- **Plotting and Visualization:**
    - The x-axis of the output plot is now more informative, displaying time in both total seconds and a `minutes:seconds` format for easier interpretation of longer recordings.
    - The plot's y-axis range for signal amplitude was adjusted for better visualization of the waveform.
- **User Experience:**
    - The `main` function was refactored to launch the `BPMApp` GUI instead of automatically processing all files in a directory.
    - The application now provides real-time status updates (e.g., "Analyzing...", "Complete") and displays clear error messages to the user.
### üêõ Bug Fixes
- The `downsample_factor` in the core processing parameters was changed from `10` in `v0.1` to `50` in `v0.2` within the `preprocess_audio` function and changed from `100` to `100` in the main function. This change likely addresses performance on larger files.
- The script now correctly handles the case where `pydub`/`FFmpeg` are not installed when attempting to convert non-WAV files, showing an error message in the GUI instead of just in the console.

# Changelog: BPM Analysis Script
## Version 0.3
This version focuses on improving the core beat detection algorithm to handle cases where beats might be missed, leading to more accurate and robust BPM analysis, especially in noisy recordings.
### üöÄ Improvements
- **Peak Detection Algorithm: Beat Rescue Logic**
    - The `find_heartbeat_peaks` function has been significantly enhanced with a new multi-step process to prevent missed beats:
        1. **Initial Analysis:** The algorithm first performs the S1-S2 pairing to create an initial set of candidate heartbeats, same as in v0.2.
        2. **Interval Validation:** It then analyzes the time intervals between these candidate beats.
        3. **Missed Beat Rescue:** If an interval is determined to be "suspiciously long" (i.e., it would imply a sudden, physiologically unlikely drop in heart rate), the algorithm now re-examines the original raw signal within that specific time window. It searches for any previously discarded peaks in that segment and "rescues" the most prominent one, adding it back into the list of beats.
    - This refinement makes the algorithm more resilient to artifacts and noise that might have caused weaker heartbeats to be initially overlooked.
### üêõ Bug Fixes
- A potential bug in the final filtering stage was addressed to prevent duplicate peaks from being added to the final list after the new "beat rescue" logic has been applied.
_(No other significant changes were made to the GUI or other functions.)_

# Changelog: BPM Analysis Script
## Version 0.4
This version introduces a more intelligent and adaptive peak detection algorithm, specifically designed to improve accuracy for recordings with very high heart rates. It also includes more detailed debugging output.
### üöÄ Improvements
- **Peak Detection Algorithm: Adaptive Logic for High BPM**
    - The `find_heartbeat_peaks` function now dynamically changes its strategy based on an estimated BPM.
    - **High BPM Mode:** If an initial BPM estimate (or a user-provided hint) is above a certain threshold (160 BPM), the algorithm switches to a "very strict" S1-S2 pairing logic. This uses a much shorter, fixed time interval to identify the S1-S2 heart sound pair, which is critical for accuracy at high speeds where the two sounds are very close together.
    - **Moderate BPM Mode:** For lower heart rates, the algorithm continues to use the more flexible, dynamically-calculated S1-S2 interval from previous versions.
- **Initial Peak Finding:** The parameters for the initial `find_peaks` function (`prominence` and `height`) have been made less strict. This allows the algorithm to capture more potential raw peaks at the start, which gives the downstream adaptive logic and beat rescue logic more data to work with, improving the chances of finding the correct beats.
- **Debugging:** Extensive `print` statements have been added throughout the `find_heartbeat_peaks` function to provide a detailed, step-by-step log of the detection process. This is invaluable for troubleshooting and understanding how the final set of peaks was chosen.

# Changelog: BPM Analysis Script
## Version 0.5
This version represents a significant architectural improvement to the core beat detection algorithm, replacing the semi-static logic with a fully dynamic approach that is much more responsive to heart rate variability.
### ‚ú® New Features
- **Fully Dynamic S1-S2 Pairing Algorithm:**
    - The previous peak detection logic, which set a single S1-S2 interval threshold at the start of the analysis, has been completely replaced.
    - The new algorithm continuously updates the S1-S2 interval threshold based on a rolling window of the most recent beat-to-beat intervals.
    - This allows the analysis to adapt in real-time to accelerations and decelerations in heart rate within the same recording, significantly improving accuracy on audio with high variability.
### üöÄ Improvements
- **More Granular Initial Threshold:** The logic for setting the _initial_ S1-S2 interval from a user-provided `start_bpm_hint` is more nuanced, providing a better starting point for the new dynamic algorithm.
- **Increased BPM Range:** The default `max_bpm` parameter in the application has been raised from 220 to 270 to reflect the enhanced capability of the new algorithm to handle very high heart rates.
- **Algorithm Refinement:** A minor tweak was made to the fallback calculation within the "Beat Rescue" logic.](<# Changelog: BPM Analysis Script

# Changelog: BPM Analysis Script
## Version 0.6
This version introduces a fundamental change in the beat detection philosophy, moving from a single complex function to a clearer, multi-stage "Relax and Refine" strategy. This makes the algorithm more robust and easier to debug.
### ‚ú® New Features
- **"Relax and Refine" Peak Detection Strategy:** The core `find_heartbeat_peaks` function was entirely re-architected into a sequential, four-step process:
    1. **Broad Peak Detection:** The algorithm now starts with a very "relaxed" initial peak detection phase. It uses minimal distance and prominence constraints specifically to capture _all_ potential sound events, including both the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) heart sounds.
    2. **Logical Beat Grouping:** The script then processes the rich list of raw peaks from the first step. It logically groups them into beats by identifying plausible S1-S2 pairs based on timing. This is a significant change from previous versions which attempted to find only S1 peaks from the start.
    3. **Beat Rescue:** The successful "beat rescue" logic from previous versions is retained. It now operates on the more reliable list of candidate beats from the grouping step to find any beats that were missed in noisy sections.
    4. **Final BPM Filtering:** The final, strict filter that ensures the interval between beats is within a physiologically plausible BPM range is kept as the last step to clean up any remaining anomalies.
### üöÄ Improvements
- **Algorithmic Clarity:** By separating the detection, grouping, and refining steps, the code's logic is now much clearer and more maintainable.
- **Robustness:** The new approach is less likely to miss S2 sounds and is better able to distinguish them from noise, leading to a more accurate set of candidate beats for the subsequent refining steps.

# Changelog: BPM Analysis Script
## Version 0.7
This version evolves the beat detection strategy by introducing a new "confidence score" metric. This makes the beat grouping logic more intelligent and adds powerful new debugging capabilities to the visualization.
### ‚ú® New Features
- **Confidence-Based S1-S2 Pairing:**
    - A new preliminary analysis step has been added. It calculates the **normalized amplitude deviation** between all adjacent raw peaks to generate a "confidence score." This score quantifies how likely a pair of peaks is a true S1-S2 couplet versus random noise.
    - The beat grouping logic now uses a dual-criteria system: a pair of peaks is only grouped into a single heartbeat if both the **time interval** is appropriate AND the **confidence score** is above a set threshold.
- **Advanced Debugging in Plots:**
    - **Detailed Hover Information:** The interactive plot now has rich tooltips. Hovering over any peak (both raw and final) displays its status and the reasoning behind the algorithm's decision (e.g., "S1 (Kept)", "S2 (Discarded)", "Lone S1 (Confidence too low)").
    - **New Data Traces:** The plot includes new, initially hidden traces for the "Normalized Deviation" and "Pairing Confidence" scores, allowing for in-depth visual debugging of the algorithm's performance.
### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring
- **Algorithm Simplification (for Debugging):** To isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the new confidence-based system, the "Beat Rescue" and "Final BPM Filtering" steps (Steps 4 and 5 from v0.6) have been temporarily removed from the `find_heartbeat_peaks` function.

# Changelog: BPM Analysis Script
## Version 0.8
This major update transforms the beat detection algorithm from a stateless process to a **stateful** one. The algorithm now maintains an internal "belief" about the heart rate, allowing it to make more context-aware and intelligent decisions as it analyzes the audio.
### ‚ú® New Features
- **Stateful Long-Term BPM Tracking:**
    - The core of the new system is a `long_term_bpm` variable that acts as the algorithm's "belief" about the current heart rate.
    - This belief is initialized using the user's hint (or a default) and is then continuously updated after each beat is identified. The update is smoothed and rate-limited to prevent erratic jumps while still being responsive to real changes in heart rate.
- **Blended Confidence Model:**
    - The previous confidence function has been replaced with a more sophisticated `calculate_blended_confidence` model.
    - This new function is dynamic, producing different confidence scores for the same peak deviation based on the current `long_term_bpm`. It effectively has different models for resting, exercise, and exertion heart rates, and blends between them.
- **Heuristic Overrides and Boosts:**
    - **Pattern Match Override:** A new heuristic has been added that looks for a classic High-Low amplitude pattern between adjacent peaks. If this pattern is detected along with a significant local amplitude deviation, it will override the confidence model and force a pairing, catching obvious beats the model might otherwise miss.
    - **Confidence Boost:** The system now boosts the confidence score for potential pairs that would correspond to a sudden (but plausible) increase in heart rate, making it better at catching the start of an acceleration.
### üöÄ Improvements
- **Visualization:** A new "Long-Term BPM (Belief)" trace has been added to the interactive plot. This allows for powerful debugging, making it possible to visualize how the algorithm's internal state evolves and influences decisions throughout the analysis.
