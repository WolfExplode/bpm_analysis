# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the BPM Analysis application to improve performance and efficiency without altering its core functionality. The application analyzes audio files to detect heartbeats, calculate BPM (beats per minute), and generate visualizations. The optimization aims to reduce processing time, memory usage, and improve overall responsiveness while maintaining the exact same analytical results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the BPM analysis to run faster so that I can process audio files more quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio files THEN the system SHALL complete the analysis in less time than the current implementation.
2. WHEN analyzing large audio files THEN the system SHALL use optimized algorithms to reduce computational complexity.
3. WHEN performing batch processing THEN the system SHALL maintain the same accuracy as the original implementation.
4. WHEN optimizing the code THEN the system SHALL NOT alter the analytical results compared to the original implementation.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to use less memory so that it can handle larger audio files without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio files THEN the system SHALL use less memory than the current implementation.
2. WHEN working with large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement memory-efficient data structures.
3. WHEN performing calculations on audio data THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary data duplication.
4. WHEN generating plots and visualizations THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage without reducing visual quality.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be optimized for better maintainability while preserving all functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing the code THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API and function signatures.
2. WHEN implementing optimizations THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing debug information and logging.
3. WHEN refactoring algorithms THEN the system SHALL document optimization strategies for future reference.
4. WHEN improving performance THEN the system SHALL NOT remove any existing features or capabilities.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the GUI to remain responsive during analysis so that I can continue using the application while processing is ongoing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing analysis THEN the system SHALL maintain UI responsiveness.
2. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL provide accurate progress updates.
3. WHEN optimizing background processing THEN the system SHALL ensure thread safety.
4. WHEN handling large files THEN the system SHALL implement progressive processing where possible.
